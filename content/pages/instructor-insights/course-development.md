_In this section, Philip Tan and Richard Eberhardt discuss how the course has evolved._

Many of the revisions in the course have been to project requirements and guidelines. We have increasingly looked for external clients for the final project to give a more grounded requirement to the project and to motivate the students, since their games may be used by real people. The initial two projects used to be based on specific types of games (make a card game, make a board game) and instead have become building blocks that are focused on preparing the students for the final project. The first project is now designed to be simple - encouraging students to iterate on a single mechanic to fully explore its use in the game. The second project is always a bit more complex, focusing the students on a particular experience that will be useful for the final project.
